7. **Manual Testing**
    - Various browsers and devices; the project was shared in the peer-code-review CI slack room and was tested by other CI Students, Mentors, Alumni and Tutors. 
This is in direct relation to the 'Goals' and 'User Stories' from the 'UX' Section.
The results of this were -
        1. Users can easily understand the main purpose of the site.
        2. It's colorful and engaging.
        4. Users can find what they're looking for quickly and easily, using the navbar links.
        5. The website is easy to use and has easy to follow instructions.
        6. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user.
        8. Links in the navbar are labelled clearly.
        9. Information is layed out clearly and is easy to read.

    - The developer tested all the nav links, clicking them one at a time confirming that they take the user to the correct page.
    - The 'Home' navlink was tested resulting in the 'Home' page being loaded as programmed.
    - The 'Meet The Aviatrices' navlink was tested resulting in the 'Meet The Aviatrices' page being loaded.
    - The 'Gallery' navlink was tested resulting in the 'Gallery' page being loaded as expected.
    - The 'Find out More' modal was opened on every page to check it didn't cause any issues.
    - The form within the modal was tested for validation firstly inputing incorrect data into the first field, then the second and finally the third. Validation was clear with simple instructions on every field.
    - The 'Submit' and 'Cancel' buttons both close the modal.
    - On the 'Home' page the 'More Pilots' button was clicked which loaded the 'Meet The Aviatrices' page as expected.
    - On the 'Home' page the 'More Images' button was clicked which loaded the 'Gallery' page as expected.
    - The developer checked the navlinks from the other pages and they all loaded thier respective pages as programmed.      

The developer used dev tools to check the resposiveness of all the apps pages, using the dropdown burger menu, which opened from the left as programmed, to click every page link. The 'Top' button was pressed on every page to test for the required action on smaller screen sizes, with the correct response given. The images were viewed and buttons all pressed on various browser sizes in dev tools to check responsiveness, along with forms and the search bar. All pages and thier contents were fully responsive whilst maintaining user friendly design aspects.

8. **Open Issues:**
   
   - Modal required field can be sightly out of line on some mobile views.

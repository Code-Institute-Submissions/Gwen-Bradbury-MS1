           <p>On March 8th 1910, Raymonde de Laroche became the world's first licenced female pilot.
           <br>Yet in 2020, only a mere 5.26% of pilots are women. And of all captains, only 1.42% are female.<br>
               According to statistics, from the International Society of Women Airline Pilots, the total number of women 
               captains in europe, wouldn't even fill a Boeing 747.</p>
           <p>Because of this, many organisations have been created to promote women in aviation and get more ladies into the captains seat!
           <br>One of these organisations being 'The 99's, International Organization of Women Pilots'.<br></p>
           <p>The 99's were founded in New York, 1929, and in 1931, Amelia Earhart was elected first president. 
               Earhart became the first female passenger to cross the Atlantic by aeroplane (accompanying pilot Wilmer Stultz), for which she achieved celebrity status. 
               In 1932, piloting a Lockheed Vega 5B, Earhart made a nonstop solo transatlantic flight, becoming the first woman to achieve such a feat.
           <br>In spite of Earharts disappearance in 1937, the 99's have continued to promote women in aviation.<br> 
               Offering scholarships, encouragement, support and unity, within the aviation industry, the 99's have become a place of belonging for many women across the globe.</p>

           <p>Other aviation pioneers include the WASP's. Short for Women Airforce Service Pilots, these brave women were trained to fly
              military aircraft during WWII, so male pilots could be released for combat duty.</p>
           <p>In 1944, two years after the start of the WASP training program, the graduation ceremony for the last WASP class was held.<br>
              During this ceremony Henry 'Hop' Arnold, the Commanding General of the US Army Air Forces at the time, stated that when the program started he wasn't sure 
              "whether a slip of a girl could fight the controls of a B-17 in heavy weather.
               Now in 1944, it is on the record that women can fly as well as men," </p>
           <p>A few more than 1,100 young women, all civilian volunteers, flew almost every type of military aircraft — including the B-26 and B-29 bombers — as part of the WASP program. 
              They ferried new aeroplanes long distances from factories to military bases and departure points across the country. They tested newly overhauled aeroplanes. 
              And they towed targets to give ground and air gunners training shooting — with live ammunition.</p>
           <p>The WASP's were granted military status in 1970's and, 65 years after their service, were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by President Obama.<br>
              The highest civilian honour given by US Congress.</p> 
           <p>So whats stopping you become one of the next generation of women pilots?</p>
